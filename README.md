When searching for "presentation feedback tool" or something similar, I found
nothing that allowed me to get feedback on a presentation I am going to give
next week. Naturally, I had to create it.

You can use my installation of this software (see link above) for free, or
install a version for yourself.

## Installing

Installing requires a MySQL/MariaDB server. Optionally, for all features to
function, PHP's `mail()` function should work. Modify `config.php` and place
all files in a folder on your website. It requires PHP 5.4 or maybe 5.3. The
database setup is automatic. See `dbsetup.php` for which tables are created.

provided that:

- your copy includes a link to this Github repository visible to users; and
- you unconditionally provide a copy of the source code including your
  modifications.

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are welcome, particularly on the front of design or
extra features. It's rather basic right now, though that suits my purposes at
the moment.

If there is anyhing you wish to see but cannot make it yourself, let me know
(open an issue) and if I have time, I might be able to write it.
